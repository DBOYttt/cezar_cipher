# cezar_cipher
The program is very simple, let you choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the string, then ask the user for the string and key.

Program two uses the functions caesar_cipher(plaintext, key) and caesar_decipher(ciphertext, key) to encrypt/decrypt text with an offset key.

only python3 can be included in the program
